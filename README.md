# Messaging App - Frontend & Backend

This is a full-stack messaging app with a **React frontend** and a **Node.js backend** using **Socket.IO** for real-time communication. Below are the instructions on how to run the app locally, deploy to **Render** (or similar cloud services), and make changes to the deployed app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js): Used to manage project dependencies.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.
- **GitHub account**: For pushing and managing your code.
- **Render account**: [Create an account on Render](https://render.com/) for deploying the app.

## Local Setup

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name/front-end
   ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React app locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The frontend will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. The frontend communicates with the backend (Socket.IO) at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

### Backend Setup (Node.js + Socket.IO)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../back-end
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The backend will be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

4. If you’re working on the backend, make sure to change the CORS settings to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` during local development. You can change the CORS settings in `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   origin: 'http://localhost:3000'
   ```

## Deploy to Render

You can deploy both the frontend and backend on **Render**. Follow these steps for each.

### Frontend Deployment

1. Create a new **Static Site** on Render:
   - Log in to Render and go to the **Dashboard**.
   - Click **New** and choose **Static Site**.
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the frontend.
   - Set the **Build Command**:
     ```bash
     npm install && npm run build
     ```
   - Set the **Publish Directory** to `build/`.

2. Deploy the frontend:
   - Click **Create Static Site**.
   - Once the deployment is done, the frontend will be available on Render at `https://your-frontend-app.onrender.com`.

### Backend Deployment

1. Create a new **Web Service** for the backend on Render:
   - Log in to Render and go to the **Dashboard**.
   - Click **New** and choose **Web Service**.
   - Connect your GitHub repository containing the backend.
   - Set the **Build Command** to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Set the **Start Command** to run the backend:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - The backend will automatically listen on a dynamic port provided by Render (`process.env.PORT`).

2. Deploy the backend:
   - Click **Create Web Service**.
   - Once deployed, the backend will be accessible at `https://your-backend-app.onrender.com`.

---

## Redeploy After Changes

If you make any changes to the backend or frontend and want to redeploy:

1. **Push your changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Made changes to the backend/frontend"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Automatic Redeployment**:
   - **Frontend**: Render automatically redeploys the frontend after pushing to GitHub.
   - **Backend**: Render automatically redeploys the backend after pushing to GitHub.

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - You can monitor your deployments from the **Render Dashboard** by checking the **Logs** for both the frontend and backend.

4. **Check if everything is working**:
   - Once deployed, verify that both the frontend and backend are working by visiting their respective URLs.

## Notes

- **CORS Configuration**: When deploying the backend to Render, remember to update the `origin` for CORS settings to match the frontend’s production URL:
  ```javascript
  origin: 'https://your-frontend-app.onrender.com'
  ```
- **Real-time Features**: The backend uses **Socket.IO** to provide real-time messaging. Ensure that the backend is running correctly and accessible from the frontend.

---

### Conclusion

You now have all the steps to set up the **frontend**, **backend**, and deploy them to **Render**. Make sure to follow the instructions and adjust CORS configurations for production.

Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or run into issues during deployment!
